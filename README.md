To use, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` and launch the game with `python3 player.py`  
The `weights` directory contains some pre-trained models. You can select the model to use by changing `games_number` im `player.py` or train a new model by setting `skip_training` to `False` with your desired number of games.
